## sketch_toy_online

Like the [Dad-Joke-Machine-Online](https://github.com/alpiepho/magtag_jokes_online) project, this project is inspired by the Adafruit project [Sketch Drawing Toy]https://learn.adafruit.com/sketch-drawing-toy.

That hardware project is still in progress and will be linked here when completed.

This is a simple Flutter web application that plays like the Sketch toy.

## Operation

TBD

- buttons
    - on/off
    - left (up/down)
    - right (side to side)
    - middle switch (pen up/down)
    - middle switch pen color??
    - reset button
- screen
- settings

<!-- 
The application from the above URL will open a respoonsive web page. It is best viewed on a mobile phone with the most testing on and iPhoneX. If opened on iPhone Safari, you can used the middle bottom button to add to the Home Screen (as a PWA).
